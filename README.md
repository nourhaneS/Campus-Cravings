# Campus-Cravings

Project Name: Campus Cravings
Project Description
Campus Cravings is a web-based project that aims to be a guide for students seeking affordable and delicious food options in Abu Dhabi. The overall theme is about good food meeting the student budget. The goal was to create an engaging, visually-appealing, and user-friendly website that offers students a curated list of eateries and dining options, reviews, recommendations, and recipes.

Process
The project was implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

The first step was to define the layout of the website, which was accomplished using HTML.
Next, I used CSS to style the website to make the website visually appealing while also ensuring that the information was easy to read and understand and added styles for the text, background, and images, and also animations for elements like the website title. Then I used JavaScript to add interactivity to the website like the carousel for the images and added the feature for the website title "Campus Cravings" to fade in and out to grab the visitor's attention.

Reflection/Evaluation
Looking back, I think the initial goals for the project were successfully achieved. The final version of Campus Cravings provides a visually appealing, engaging, and user-friendly platform for students to discover affordable and delicious dining options in Abu Dhabi.

I learned a lot about web development throughout the process of building this website. I had to tackle challenges with regards to layout design, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality, but I managed to overcome most of them other than the website sizing which I wasn’t able to fix no matter what i tried and build a functional website that I’m proud of. Going forward, I would like to finish it by reviewing more places and adding the recipes and make this an actual website for students to use.
